# GettingDataProject
This repository contains the run_analysis.R and CodeBook.Rmd files for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. The project entails creating a tidy data set, working from a data set by the University of California Irvine, "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" (UCI HAR). The UCI HAR data set contains data collected from Samsung Galaxy S accelerometers during six activities performed by 30 subjects.

The analysis requires that the dplyr and reshape2 packages be installed. Both are available through CRAN.

The UCI HAR data set is downloadable at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
